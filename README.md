| **Async Performance**    | Built with `asyncio` for high-performance, non-blocking operations to handle multiple users efficiently. |
| **Enhanced Progress**    | Real-time progress updates for both downloading and uploading, keeping the user informed.                 |
| **Auto Cleanup**         | Automatically cleans up temporary files and directories to save disk space.                               |

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The project is built with a modular and scalable architecture:
*   `main.py`: The main application entry point that handles bot commands and user interactions.
*   `configs.py`: Centralized configuration management.
*   `helpers/`: A directory containing all the core logic modules:
    *   `downloader.py`: Handles downloading videos from URLs.
    *   `gofile_uploader.py`: Manages uploads to GoFile.io.
    *   `uploader.py`: Orchestrates the dual upload process.
    *   `merger.py`: Contains the FFmpeg logic for merging videos.
    *   `clean.py`: Manages the cleanup of temporary files.
    *   `database/`: Handles all interactions with the MongoDB database.
